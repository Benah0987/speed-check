Introduction
This code provides a simple speed checker program that checks if a driver is within the speed limit or not, and calculates the number of demerit points the driver will receive based on their speed. If the driver has more than 12 demerit points, their license is suspended.

#Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Enter the speed of the car in km/h in the input field.
Click the "Check" button.
The program will display "Ok" if the driver is within the speed limit, "Demerit points: X" if the driver is speeding (where X is the number of demerit points the driver has received), or "License suspended" if the driver has more than 12 demerit points.
Implementation
The program is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file contains a form with an input field for the speed of the car and a button to check the speed. The JavaScript file contains the checkSpeed() function that calculates the number of demerit points and displays the result on the web page.
